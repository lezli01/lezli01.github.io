Negative Automatic Thoughts:

Throughout our lives, our thinking takes on a pattern that is specific to us, which significantly influences our moods, emotions and actions. Epictetus, an ancient Stoic philosopher, once said that people are not disturbed by the things of the world, but by the way they see it.

Patterns of thinking that develop in childhood and persist throughout a person's life. We see the world through these patterns, we evaluate the events of our lives according to them, we accept them as true. "That's just the way I am."

The patterns live within us without us even perceiving them - because we honestly believe what they dictate. They are asleep, but if we put ourselves in a situation that falls under their jurisdiction, they wake up and take over. The tools for this are negative automatic thoughts.

They are automatic thoughts with negative content, arising from our schemas, which distort our assessment of reality and therefore block the way to rational, useful thinking. Negative automatic thoughts embody a negative thought pattern (or even several at the same time).

Logical errors:

We have definite opinions about ourselves, the world, our future. If we receive information from the outside world that contradicts this - we become uncertain. We become anxious. If I am not what I think I am - what am I like? To preserve my own little inner world I distort information. Logical fallacies are the tools.
